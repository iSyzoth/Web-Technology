                    Does a paragraph need five sentences? No, a paragraph can have one or more sentences depending on the medium, topic, audience, and purpose of the text. 
                    There are no distinct guidelines on how long a paragraph should be. However, five is usually the maximum number of sentences that make up a good paragraph.
